## Virtual Camera

This project was created using Raylib with the main goal to manually implement a virtual camera. The focus is on creating basic functionalities from scratch to understand how it works.

### Overview:
Project is manual implementation of camera functions including scene navigation, zoom, and proper object occlusion. A Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) tree was used to manage object occlusion (only objects visible from the camera's perspective are displayed in proper order).
